---------------------
 Build Prerequisites
---------------------

To build Appcelerator from source, you will need the following prerequisites:

  - Ruby 1.8.6 or greater <http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/>
  - RubyGems with the following gems: rake, hoe, hpricot, json, maruku, rubyzip

To build the platform installers, you will need the following:

  - Mac OSX - you will need to install XCode 3.0 from the extra CD or download from Apple
  - Win32* - you will need to install NSIS installer <http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download>
  - Unix - no additional third-party software is required at this time.

* For building NSIS on OSX/Unix, you can download the non-Win32 compiler which will allow
you to build the Win32 installer on other OS platforms.  For example, on OSX, if you have
port installed, you can install it with:

  > port install nsis

--------------------
 Build Instructions
--------------------

To build, you can execute rake normally, like:

  > rake

To build a specific component, you can run rake with one or more tasks, like:

  > rake service:java

Each Rakefile is built into several sub-components, each within their own
directory structures and Rakefiles.  The main components are:

  - widgets
  - plugins
  - runtime (includes both command-line bindary and installers)
  - services
  - websdk

You can execute a specific component with the task <component>:<name>. For
example, to build the Java Service:

  > rake service:java

Or, to execute a build of all services, you could do:

  > rake service:all

All components have an `all` target.  For example:

  > rake widget:all
  > rake websdk:all
  > rake installer:all
