	<h2>What is Appcelerator?</h2>
	<p>
	Appcelerator is a platform that allows you to quickly build both rich and highly dynamic user interfaces (RIAs) as well as true SOA-based services in <b>Java</b>,<b> Ruby</b>, <b>.NET</b> or <b>PHP</b> - it's RIA and SOA made easy.
   </p>
	<p>
	Just so you know, we built this documentation explorer using Appcelerator.
	</p>
	<h3>Message Oriented Architecture</h3>
	<p>The foundation of the Appcelerator Platform is a Message Oriented Architecture.  What this means is that <b>ALL</b> components in an Appcelerator application communicate via simple lightweight messages.  HTML elements can both send and receive messages and all Appcelerator services are message-driven.
	</p>

	<h3>Appcelerator Client Development</h3>
	<p>The Appcelerator Platform comes with two powerful capabilities that enable you to quickly 
		build your RIA.  The first is the Appcelerator Expression Language.  The Appcelerator
		Expression Language turns simple HTML elements into powerful <b>Ajax</b> and <b>DHTML</b> components.
		The Expression Language is simple - it has only one attribute: the <tt>on</tt> attribute.
		Within the <tt>on</tt> attribute you create simple expressions that unleash the power
		of <b>Ajax</b> and <b>DHTML</b> without having to use Javascript.  Details about the Appcelerator
		Expression Language are covered in more detail in this Explorer.
	</p>
 	<p>The Appcelerator Platform also comes with a set of pre-packaged widgets that allow you to quickly assemble the most common components in a RIA.  This Explorer contains examples of all of the current widgets with examples on how to use each of them
	</p>
	<h3>Appcelerator Service Development</h3>
	<p>As we mentioned earlier, Appcelerator Services can be built in <b>Java</b>,<b> Ruby</b>,<b>.NET</b> or <b>PHP</b>.  Examples of how to implement services in each language are provided in this Explorer.
	</p>
