Description:
    The generator creates stubs for a new Appcelerator Service.

    The generator takes a class name, message type and method name as arguments.
    The messagehandler name may be given in CamelCase or under_score and should
    not be suffixed with 'Service'.  

    The generator creates a service class in app/services.

    ./script/generate service <ServiceClassName> <ServiceMessageRequest> <ServiceMethod> [ServiceMessageResponse]

    The following are the arguments:
    
    ServiceClassName      - name of the service class
    ServiceMessageRequest - message request type
    ServiceMethod         - method name to call
    ServiceMessageRequest - message response type

Example:
    ./script/generate service CreditCard service.creditcard.charge.request charge [service.creditcard.charge.response]
