                Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely  <br />
                The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,  <br />
                The insolence of office, and the spurns  <br />
                That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,  <br />
                When he himself might his quietus make  <br />
                With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,  <br />
                To grunt and sweat under a weary life,  <br />
                But that the dread of something after death,  <br />
                The undiscovered country, from whose bourn  <br />
                No traveller returns, puzzles the will,  <br />
                And makes us rather bear those ills we have  <br />

                To be, or not to be - that is the question: <br />
                Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer  <br />
                The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune  <br />
                Or to take arms against a sea of troubles  <br />
                And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep -   <br />
                No more - and by a sleep to say we end  <br />
                The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks <br /> 
                That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation  <br />
                Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep -   <br />
                To sleep - perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub,  <br />
                For in that sleep of death what dreams may come  <br />
                When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,  <br />
                Must give us pause. There's the respect  <br />
                That makes calamity of so long life.  <br />
                For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,  <br />
                Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely  <br />
                The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,  <br />
                The insolence of office, and the spurns  <br />
                That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,  <br />
                When he himself might his quietus make  <br />
                With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,  <br />
                To grunt and sweat under a weary life,  <br />
                But that the dread of something after death,  <br />
                The undiscovered country, from whose bourn  <br />
                No traveller returns, puzzles the will,  <br />
                And makes us rather bear those ills we have  <br />
                Than fly to others that we know not of?  <br />
